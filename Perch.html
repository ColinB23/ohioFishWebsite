				<h2>Where to find them</h2>
				<section>
				<p>Perch are found in rivers, lakes, and streams. You should target areas that hold bait fish. These smaller fish will hold where they feel safe and camouflaged around
				weed lines, brush piles, near lily pads, or any other type of structure that may afford a hiding place for bait fish. As with many other game fish, the smaller fish will be found shallower, 
				with the larger fish tending to be in deeper water.

					<h2>Types of Lures to Use and How to Fish Them</h2>
				<section>
				<p>Perch have small mouths so lighter lures are better. Small jigs are great for perch and you should slowly twitch it up and then let it sink and repeat. Perch are usually found in deeper waters near the bottm.
				Spoons are also great for perch and can attract their attention with the flashing.
