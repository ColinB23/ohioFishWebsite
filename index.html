					<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<section>
					<p>Fishing in Ohio is a great activity that many people enjoy here in Ohio. You
					get to spend time outside and it is very peaceful. It can also get really exciting
					once you are hooked on a fish. Ohio has many great places to fish including Lake
					Erie which hosts many bass fishing tournaments.

				<h2>The Basics</h2>
				<section>
				<p>Before you can start fishing you need a couple things. First you will have to get your 
				fishing license which costs about twenty dollars for a full year. You will also need a rod
				and reel with some artifical or live bait. Artificial and live baits both have their own advantages
				and you should try both to see what you like more. You will also need fishing line to get your rod and reel set up.
				After all of that you should be ready to go fishing and make your first casts.
