					<h1>Spring Fishing</h1>
					</header>
		
					<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<section>
					<p>Fishing in the spring is one of the best times to fish. Most of the best spring fishing locations will still have cold water. 
					However, if you can find areas that are slightly warmer than the rest of the waterway you’re fishing then you might be in business. 
					For example, seek out shallow areas to fish that warm faster in the sun. Warmer spots will aggregate forage and ultimately more fish. 
					During this season, bass are feeding heavily at every depth and attack a variety of lures as the water warms.

					<h2>Types of Lures to Use and How to Fish Them</h2>
				<section>
				<p>The spring bite is much less explosive than say summer top water fishing for bass in the summer. Fish are reluctant to strike anything, 
				especially fishing lures that are big and moving fast. Probably the most important early spring fishing tips are to downsize your baits. It
				doesn’t matter what species you’re fishing for, smaller baits worked deathly slow will get you bit more often. If catching a bunch of fish 
				is all your about, then you better bring some live bait. It is easy to fish slow and requires less computation from a fish’s perspective. 
				That is, a fish doesn’t have to think twice before biting like it may do when presented with artificial lures. Nightcrawlers and minnows 
				bottom-bounced on a jig or rigged on a single hook and a bobber are always effective.
				Action lures such as crankbaits and spinnerbaits produce most of the time, but when the water temperature lingers below 60 degrees and during 
				cold-front situations later in the spring, bass prefer slower presentations. While soft plastics or jigs work well in these situations, you can 
				still catch bass on hard plastic lures throughout all phases of spring weather and water conditions.
