					<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<section>
					<p>When summer fishing is on the agenda, start shallow early then progressively move deeper.
					Shallow coves and flats so productive just a month ago suddenly empty of life as fish seek shelter in deeper waters.
					In the summer, you want to be fishing at dusk and dawn. The fish move to the cooler areas of water during this time.

					<h2>Types of Lures to Use and How to Fish Them</h2>
				<section>
				<p>Hollow body topwater lures are great for when it's cool outside in the summer. Morning is open season for topwater, but once
				the sun comes up and the heat sets in, it’s time to put the other baits down and pick up a frog or a similar hollow body bait.
				Reaction baits can be great in the summertime, especially first thing in the morning and in the evening. However, on overcast days 
				or when the fish are more active, these shallow water techniques can catch them all day long. Fish them along weedlines and around 
				docks, taking advantage of the shade they create. Wind and spinnerbaits are best friends. When the water is kicked up and bait moves 
				toward the shore, bass can’t resist the flash of a spinnerbait. Find a mudline along a windy bank and you can find a fun day of fishing.
				It’s well known that worms work year-round. Try texas rigging a worm and casting by brush. Deep crank baits are a great bait for the summer
				to get down to those cooler areas n the water.
