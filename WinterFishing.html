					<h1>Winter Fishing</h1>
					</header>
		
					<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<section>
					<p>As winter slowing morphs into spring, fish become increasingly primed for feeding. Countless schools of perch and bluegills as well as largemouth bass, trout, and muskies 
					start to seek out forage. This puts you as the angler at an advantage. It also means late winter fishing in Ohio can be some of the best of the year.

					<h2>Types of Lures to Use and How to Fish Them</h2>
				<section>
				<p>Deep diving jerk baits are great for the winter. You should twitch or jerk your rod and short bursts using this rod to mimick a dieing baitfish. A jigging spoon is another great choic for winter fishing.
				This bait gets to the bottom and into the strike zone with blazing speed and can be worked in place easily on a vertical presentation with a simple snap and fall on slack line.
				The drop shot is a very good choice and is one of the only soft plastic baits fish will go after in the winter. You want to work this bait very slowly and let it sit at the bottom for long periods of time.
				You want to butt it up against a rock or a stump and work it painfully slow around an isolated object. But sometimes just barely flicking the tail is all the action it needs.
