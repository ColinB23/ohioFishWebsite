					<h1>Pike Fishing</h1>
					</header>
		
					<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<section>
					<p>Pike are a very unique fish and are very fun to catch.They are usually caught in the spring and fall but can be caught in the summer. They are one of the most aggressive fish and have a long slender body which gives them incredible power. You'll know when you hook into a pike
					because there isn't anything else like it. These fish have a unique pattern and very sharp teeth. It's very easy to tell if the fish you caught is a pike because they are so unique and look like no other fish.
					Be very carful when unhooking this fish because they are very dangerous and thrash around. You are best using some pliers to get your lure out of its mouth and this fish is not afraid to bite down on a finger.

					<h2>Types of Lures to Use and How to Fish Them</h2>
				<section>
				<p>Spinnerbaits are a good choice to attract the attention of the pike. In early spring, before weed growth becomes a factor, focus on covering water.
				The bigger spinners are a top choice here because the weight lets you cast them farther and the blades throw more flash. Retrieve the spinner steadily, just fast enough to keep it off the bottom.
				Spoons are another good choice.Start by steadily and slowly reeling, just fast enough to keep the spoon wobbling. If that doesnâ€™t produce, try a flutter retrieve, accomplished by imparting a jigging 
				motion as you reel. Spoons are particularly effective along drop offs because you can precisely control the depth.
