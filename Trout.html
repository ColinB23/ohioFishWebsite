					<h2>Types of Lures to Use and How to Fish Them</h2>
				<section>
				<p>Tubes imitate zooplankton and other easy snacks all fish snack on. This lure is highly productive and you can reel it in steadily, twitch it in bursts, or use it like a jig and slowly flick it up.
				Swimbaits are great for strams and rivers with a strong current. Trout love to feast on smaller baitfish, especially bigger trout. The best way to trigger strikes when they are up feeding on
				baitfish is a paddletail swimbait that can disrupt the column. Just reel this bait in there isn't anything special to it. Small spinners are another great lure for trout fishing. This is similar to a swim bait but the flashing van tend to attract more fish.
