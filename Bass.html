					<h1>Bass Fishing</h1>
					</header>
		
					<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<section>
					<p>Bass are mainly caught in the spring, summer, and fall. There are two types of bass which are largemouth and smallmouth. Largemouth can get bigger but smallmouth are more aggressive.
					All bass are aggressive fish though and that's why they are so fun to catch. When you catch a bass it is safe to grab them by the mouth because they barely have teeth. Bass can get all the way up
					to the size of ten lbs athough this is very rare. A five lb fish is considered a very good fish. Bass don't taste the best and are rarely fished for food and mostly fished for fun.

				<h2>Where to find them</h2>

					<h2>Types of Lures to Use and How to Fish Them</h2>
				<section>
				<p>There are so many different types of bass fishing lure but I will just cover what you need to get started. Crankbaits are great bass fishing lures and you can use them over and over again. You should
				have both a deep diving crankbait and a shallow one. These baits are easy to use and you just reel them in. Next are spinnerbaits. Spinnerbaits are a staple in bass fishing because they just work.
				Nothing too special about spinnerbaits you just reel them in and they attract fish. The last baits you should get are soft plastic worms or craws. These can get ruined after a certain amount of catches
				but are perfect if you don't want to keep buying live bait. You can texas rig these to make them weedless and you won't get snagged. You can also put the craw on the back of a spinner or jig to give it a bigger presentation.
