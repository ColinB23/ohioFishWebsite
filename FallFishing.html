					<h1>Fall Fishing</h1>
					</header>
		
					<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<section>
					<p>Fishing in the fall is a great time to fish in Ohio. In the fall fish are eating to prepare for the winter which gives many fisherman a big opportunity. 
					In the fall, the fish are out in the main creek channel drops where there are a lot of rocks and larger structures. Fish are more likely to come out in more open areas
					as the water cools down. The fall is a great time to try out new techniques or baits because almost anything will work.

					<h2>Types of Lures to Use and How to Fish Them</h2>
				<section>
				<p>It is common to see bass on the surface chasing baitfish near this vegetation during fall, which provides a great opportunity for topwater baits. Topwater baits are
				easy to use and are great for open water. Swim jigs work well around structure and vegetation, exactly where bass will be lurking. Swim jigs are one of the best fall fishing lures to imitate baitfish.
				Spinnerbaits are great for the fall and can be fished around cover. Spinnerbaits are easy to catch the attention of fish because of the flash they give off and the vibrations they make in the water.
				A soft plastic craw is one of the best baits to use because of how versatile it is. You can fish this weightless, with a weight, or put it on the back of a jig. This bait can also catch many different 
				species.
